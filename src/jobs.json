This then gives them tools that enable them to access growing markets and thereby increase their incomes.\n\nHiH Eastern Africa perceives of the government’s focus on job creation as monumental and therefore strives to participate in this agenda with incomparable enthusiasm. It works through social mobilization and enterprise training in various communities to help these to discover their entrepreneurial talents and potential. This improves incomes and food sufficiency alleviating poverty.\n\nOur unique approach towards eradicating poverty in Eastern Africa encompasses four key strategies namely; Outreach Programs, Partnerships, Collaborations and Networking. These strategies aid in forming solid synergies with the organization’s partners and members.",
